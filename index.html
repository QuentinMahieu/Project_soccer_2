          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>As you navigate through the multiple charts available we can observe some interesting facts between<br> 
            <strong>the lack of healtcare, smoker's rate and obesity rate </strong> versus <strong>poverty rate, 
              median age and median household income</strong>:
          </p>
          <p id="first"><strong>Let's first observe the poverty rate :</strong><br>
            We observe a small positive correlation between the poverty rate and the lack a healthcare in the different regions. This means 
            the higher the poverty rate in a region the bigger the lack of healthcare.<br>
            The observation is the same between the smoker's rate and the poverty rate. This correlation seems a bit stronger than
            the previous one. The higher the poverty rate in a region, the higher the smoker's rate.<br>
            We observe the same trend between obesity and poverty rate. The higher the poverty rate the higher the obesity rate.
            This is the strongest positive correlation observed for the poverty rate.
          </p>
          <p id="first"><strong>Let's now observe the median age :</strong><br> 
            We observe a small negative correlation between the median age and the lack of healthcare. This means that the younger,
            the less subscriptions to a healthcare are observed in a region.<br>
            The correlation is less visible between the median age and the percent smokers in a region. A small positive correlation<br>
            The median age doesn't explain the obesity rate.No correlation visible</p>

          <p id="first"><strong>Let's finally observe the household income :</strong><br>
            We observe a small negative correlation between the median income and the lack of healthcare. This means that the less income,
            the less someone subscribes to a healthcare.<br>
            The negative correlation is much more visible between the median income and the percent smokers in a region.The less people earn, 
            the more they smoke<br>
            We observe the same trend between the obesity and the income, the obesity rate is higher where the median income is lower</p>
