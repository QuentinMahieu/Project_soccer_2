# Project_Soccer

## Our Goal:
Can we discover how to build a winning football (soccer) team?

## Our Approach:
Weâ€™re going to examine the strongest performers in three of the top leagues in Europe  (England, Spain and Italy) - and see if we can determine how much of a role 5 identified variables play in success. These are:

1. **Spend on players**: 
- The total transfer fees spent on players for that season.
- Wages spent on players
2. **Average Age**: of the playing group
3. **Average Height**: of the playing group
4. **Diversity**: examining the makeup of a team by the origin of players
5. **Player Variables**: looking at the skillset that makes up a team

## First steps
1. ~~Find data sources required for analysis~~
2. Build base dataframe for each league that combines variables
3. Determine strategy of analysis for each variable
4. Allocate tasks and identify any dependencies
5. Plot out the sequencing of tasks as a guide in notebooks
